/// VC-1 detection (issue #51).
///
/// VC-1 comes in three profiles and the distinction decides whether the
/// default engine can play it:
///
///  * **Simple / Main** — old hardware decoders, when present, handle these.
///  * **Advanced** (`WVC1`) — essentially no Android device has a hardware
///    decoder for it, yet the platform still *advertises* VC-1.
///
/// That combination is the bug. Media3 picks the advertised decoder, it
/// initialises, and it then emits black frames **without raising an error**,
/// so an error-triggered software fallback never fires. Audio and subtitles are
/// separate pipelines and keep working, which is what makes it look like a
/// rendering fault rather than a decode fault.
///
/// The ExoPlayer maintainer names the same mechanism: "not all decoders fail
/// with error in these cases. Some will 'decode' frames, but show black screen
/// or distorted image… it is decoders fault to not indicate error when
/// unsupported profile is passed for decode" (google/ExoPlayer#8393).
///
/// There is no Media3-path software decoder for VC-1 — Media3's own FFmpeg
/// extension lists audio decoders only, and nextlib's video renderer claims
/// avc/hevc alone. libmpv ships full FFmpeg and plays it, which is why "Play
/// with MPV" is the working answer rather than a fallback we can select
/// internally.
///
/// Just Player (moneytoo/Player) is pure Media3 and has the identical black
/// screen; its maintainer tells users to use mpv. Nova does support VC-1, but
/// via its own C FFmpeg core, not a library we can drop in.

///  * Android has no practical VC-1 *hardware* decoder at all. VC-1 is legacy
///    — Simple and Main included — so warning on them too costs only a
///    suggestion the user can ignore.
///  * The profile is often missing from what Media3 reports. Warning only on a
///    confirmed `Advanced` would silently miss the exact file in issue #51
///    whenever the profile string is absent, which is precisely the case that
///    cannot be verified in advance.

/// A black screen with working audio and subtitles is the worst failure mode
/// there is, and the suggestion is cheap. See [isVc1AdvancedProfile] for the
