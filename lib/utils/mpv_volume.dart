// Volume model shared by the Media3 and MPV engines, and by the swipe
// gesture that drives them.
//
// ## Why boost is a gesture band and not a slider
//
// Boost is the 100-200% half of the volume gesture. The user swipes up to
// 100% as usual, keeps going, and past 100% the extra travel becomes
// over-amplification instead of system volume. It is gated behind
// Settings -> Audio -> Volume boost, because silently amplifying past 100%
// is not something to opt everyone into.
//
// ## Why the boost is staged differently per engine
//
// Media3 has a real effect chain, so `DynamicsBoost` applies a compressor
// followed by a limiter (#41: `LoudnessEnhancer` clipped audibly from ~6 dB
// and crushed dialogue out of the mix).
//
// MPV has no comparable hardware effect. Its gain therefore rides on mpv's own
// `volume` property, which is the one placement known to actually reach the
// speaker — a filter-based gain is discarded on an `audiotrack` output
// (measured on-device: `af` reads back empty). The limiter is still attached
// best-effort so a working build gets smoothing, but MPV must never *depend*
// on the filter for the boost to exist.
//
// `mpvVolumePercent` is the single place that decides the number, so the swipe
// gesture, night mode and the per-open apply cannot drift apart (#41: they
// once did, and the reporter described it as "boost works until I touch
// volume").

/// Ceiling of the gesture's boost band. 100-200% maps to 1.0x-2.0x.
const double kMaxVolumeBoost = 2.0;

/// Gesture ceiling when boost is switched off: plain system volume, 0-100%.
const double kMaxVolumeNoBoost = 1.0;

/// Ceiling for mpv's `volume`. Fixed rather than tracking the current value:
/// mpv clamps `volume` to `volume-max`, so a ceiling that moved with the boost
/// would silently clamp the volume gesture the moment it pushed past the last
/// boosted value.
const double kMpvVolumeMax = 400.0;

/// Extra lift for Night Mode, approximating the +4 dB the native engine gets
/// from its own DynamicsProcessing stage.
const double kMpvNightMultiplier = 1.6;

/// The mpv `volume` property for a [baseFraction] system volume (0..1) with
/// [boost] and [nightMode] applied.
double mpvVolumePercent({
  required double baseFraction,
  required double boost,
  required bool nightMode,
}) {
  var vol = baseFraction * 100.0;
  if (boost > 1.01) vol *= boost;
  if (nightMode) vol *= kMpvNightMultiplier;
  if (vol < 0) vol = 0;
  return vol > kMpvVolumeMax ? kMpvVolumeMax : vol;
}

/// MPV has NO peak limiter, and cannot be given one.
///
/// This is a measured, closed conclusion — five forms were tried against a real
/// device and every one failed, two of them SILENTLY:
///
/// | Form | Result |
/// |---|---|
/// | `lavfi='[alimiter=…]'` | `af` reads back EMPTY. Rejected, no error. |
/// | `lavfi-graph=alimiter=…` | `option af: lavfi-graph isn't supported` |
/// | `lavfi=graph=alimiter:a=1:b=2` | sub-options split on `:` |
/// | `lavfi=alimiter=limit=0.891` | `Error while parsing lavfi parameter alimiter (limit)` |
/// | `lavfi=alimiter` (bare) | accepted, but all defaults ⇒ `limit=1`, no limiting |
///
/// The last row is the decisive one. mpv parses everything after `lavfi=` as
/// **sub-option name=value pairs**, so a value may be a single token with no
/// `=` in it. `lavfi=anull` works for exactly that reason — one bare token,
/// which mpv maps onto the filter's `graph` sub-option. Any attempt to pass
/// filter *options* turns the filter name into a sub-option name, and the
/// whole `af` set is rejected — sometimes without a word of it.
///
/// So MPV's boost rides on `volume` alone (see [mpvVolumePercent]) and will
/// CLIP at high settings rather than limit. That is a known, accepted limit,
/// not an oversight. The engine that gets a proper compressor + limiter is the
/// native one, via `DynamicsBoost` (API 28+), which is where boost is used by
/// default. Adding a limiter to MPV would need a different filter-delivery
/// mechanism — a Lua script or a custom libmpv — not another `af` string.
/// Do not add an `af` write to `_applyMpvVolume` without re-running the probe
/// in that file first.

/// The two values a volume gesture has to push: the system volume and the
/// engine make-up.
///
/// They are deliberately separate because the OS volume is capped at 100%
/// while the boost is not, so the gesture's single 0-200% value has to be
/// split rather than multiplied. Splitting (not multiplying) is also what
/// makes "swipe to 100%, keep going for boost" behave: below 100% you are
/// changing the system volume, above it the system volume simply stays pinned
/// at max and the extra travel becomes boost.
