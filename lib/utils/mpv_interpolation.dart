/// Frame interpolation for the libmpv engine (issue #53).
///
/// mpv generates the frames that are missing between a source's own frames,
/// so 24 fps anime can be shown as 48 fps. It is a **libmpv-only** feature:
/// Media3 hands decoded frames straight to the SurfaceView, so there is no
/// renderer in which an extra frame could be produced.
///
/// Three mpv details decide whether it works at all:
///
///  * `--interpolation` is silently ignored unless `--video-sync` is one of
///    the `display-*` modes, so the sync mode has to be switched as well.
///  * The frame rate mpv interpolates *to* is the display frame rate, so the
///    target is set with `--display-fps-override` (mpv renamed it from
///    `--display-fps`; in the newer builds the old name is also a read-only
///    property, so it has to be applied with a read-back check).
///  * `--interpolation-threshold` (default 0.01) switches interpolation off
///    when the two frame rates are within 1% of each other, which would make
///    a 47.94 fps source on a 48 fps target do nothing. -1 turns that logic
///    off.
