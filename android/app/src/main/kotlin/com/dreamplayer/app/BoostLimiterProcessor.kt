/// PCM16 make-up gain with a peak limiter — the volume-boost path (issue #41).
///
/// Why this exists. `DynamicsProcessing` is the "supported" API for this, but it
/// is a vendor HAL effect: this app's test phone creates it, the reporter's
/// OnePlus Pad 2 refuses to create it at all (`setEngineArchitecture()` ->
/// "AudioEffect: bad parameter value"). The old fallback on that failure was
/// `LoudnessEnhancer`: a fixed, untunable compressor that AOSP hard-wires for
/// STEREO. Attaching it to a 5.1 session on the Pad 2 mangled the centre
/// channel — the dialogue — while the rest of the mix kept playing, so the
/// reporter heard "background music continues, vocals disappear".
///
/// So the boost lives here for every device, which also makes it the same
/// mechanism MPV uses (plain gain, no effect chain) — and the reporter
/// confirmed MPV sounds correct on the same speakers.
///
/// This processor runs INSIDE the sink, on whatever layout the decoder
/// produced, so it is channel-agnostic: six channels get six identical gains
/// and the centre channel is never dropped or summed away.
///
/// It is also a limiter, not a compressor. Only samples above the ceiling are
/// attenuated, so the mix keeps its dynamics — which is the whole point of the
/// rewrite away from `LoudnessEnhancer` (that one crushed the dialogue out of
/// the mix, see issue #41).
///
/// The limiter is a feed-forward peak limiter with an instant attack and an
/// exponential release: the gain drops the moment a sample would exceed the
/// ceiling and recovers over [RELEASE_SECONDS]. That is deliberately gentler
/// than a compressor, which would pull the whole band down and take the
/// dialogue with it.
///
/// PCM16 only, like [AudioDelayProcessor]: anything else throws
/// `UnhandledAudioFormatException` so the sink falls back to the raw path
/// (which is how HDMI bitstream passthrough survives the processor chain).
